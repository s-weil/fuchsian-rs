# fuchsian-rs

<b> Fuchsian-rs</b> is a library for visualizing (2-dimensional) <i>hyperbolic geometry</i> and the <i>dynamics</i> of <i>isometry group actions</i>, meaning subgroups of <i>PSL(2, R)</i> acting on the hyperbolic (Poincar√©) upper half plane (or disk) via <i>Moebius transformations</i>.
In particular we focus on orbits of finitely generated subgroups of <i>PSL(2, R)</i>, so called <b>Fuchsian groups</b>.

We provide several ways of visualizing orbits of group actions, namey via
- [python api](./python-api/README.md) (see [examples](./python-api/examples))
- Bevy (TODO)
- raw data exports (TODO)

### Contribution and vision

Contributions are highly welcome!

Besides many improvements to be done, further possible features and support may go in the direction of
- Diophanintine Approximation, Schmidt games
- Fundamental domains
- Dynamics on different spaces (such as billiards)
