# fuchsian-rs

<b> Fuchsian-rs</b> is a library for visualizing (2-dimensional) <i>hyperbolic geometry</i> and <i>dynamics</i> of <i>isometry group actions</i>, meaning subgroups of <i>SL(2, R)</i> via <i>Moebius transformation</i>.
In particular we focus on orbits of finitely generated subgroups of <i>PSL(2, R)</i>, so called <b>Fuchsian groups</b>.

We provide several ways of visualizing orbits of group actions, namey via
- [python api](./python-api/README.md) (see [examples](./python-api/examples)
)
- Bevy (TODO)
- raw data exports (todo)
